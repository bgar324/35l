<h1>Assignment 1. Files and shell scripting</h1>

<p><small>[<a href='../index.html'>course home</a> &gt; <a href='../assign.html'>assignments</a>]</small></p>

<section>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This assignment is designed to give you familiarity with two
  things. The first is scripting with
  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX'>POSIX</a>-compatible <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell'>
  shells</a>. The second is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs'>Emacs</a>,
  the classic programmable text editor
  that is a prototype for
  modern <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment'>integrated
  development environments</a> (IDEs).  Software developers should be expert in both shell scripting and
  IDEs, even if they don’t necessarily use POSIXish shells or Emacs
  per se.</p>
<p>As this course has no textbook, a main goal of this assignment is
  covering how you can discover details about this assignment’s topic,
  details that may not be covered in lecture. You can get
  many of the details by following all the links in this assignment
  and getting the gist of those web pages (which is something you should do,
  unless the text around a link says that you don’t need to read all
  of the referenced document).
  However, this won’t
  suffice for everything and you’ll need to do some learning-by-doing
  to do the assignment well. The idea is that you
  can put this experience to good use later in this course (and in
  real life) when you need to come up to speed with a large software
  ecosystem. That being said, don’t let yourself get discouraged
  if a detail cannot be found by reading the online documentation.
If you need a hint, ask a <abbr>TA</abbr> or an <abbr>LA</abbr>.
(This assignment is not intended to be done without any hints.)</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, please <a href='https://www.seasnet.ucla.edu/apply-for-student-account/'>sign up
        for a SEASnet account</a>. Do not delay in doing this; new SEASnet
    accounts may take multiple days to activate. You may already have a
    SEASnet account if you’re a student in the School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Do this assignment on any of the following SEASnet GNU/Linux servers
named <samp>cs35l.seas.ucla.edu</samp>,
with <samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp>
prepended to your <samp>PATH</samp>.
You can do this by executing the shell command "<samp>export
PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH</samp>" after logging in, or more
conveniently by running the <code>helper</code> script mentioned below,
which puts that shell command into
your <samp>$HOME/.profile</samp> file (but test this file by logging
in via a separate session before logging out of your first session!).
</p>
<p>You may access these servers over <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell'>SSH</a>, which is
    probably preinstalled on your device. For example, to access
    <code>lnxsrv15</code> with the username <code>eggert</code>, use the
    following command:
</p>
<pre><code>  ssh eggert@lnxsrv15.seas.ucla.edu</code></pre>
<p>Please note that SEASnet is only available within the UCLA intranet.
    If you’d like to do this assignment while outside of UCLA,
    please consider using
    a <a href='https://it.ucla.edu/it-support-center/services/virtual-private-network-vpn-clients'>VPN</a>.</p>
<p>Now, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>  <a href='https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/cp.html'>cp</a> -r ~eggert/cs35L/assign1 .
  cd assign1
  . ./helper init
</code></pre>
<p>This makes a copy of the working directory <code>assign1</code>
    you’ll use to complete these assignments. It also makes some
    modifications to your system to work with this assignment. Make sure to
    run all commands in this assignment inside this directory. Each time you
    login to SEASnet, you must change your working directory to
    <code>assign1</code> as shown above.
</p>

<h2>Laboratory: GNU/Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Emacs comes with a builtin tutorial.
    To take it, start Emacs and type <samp>control-H</samp> followed
    by lower-case <samp>t</samp>
    (in Emacs notation, <samp>C-h t</samp>).</li>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Lab 1.0: Getting started with GNU/Linux and Emacs</h3>
<p>No submission is required for this lab section, but please do it to
    make sure your system is set up correctly and to familiarize yourself
    with Emacs.</p>
<oL>
  <li>Make sure to have followed the steps in Setup.</li>
  <li>Run the shell command <samp>type emacs</samp> which should
    report that it is <samp>/usr/local/cs/bin/emacs</samp>.</li>
  <li>Run the shell command <samp>emacs --version</samp> which
    should report that it is version 30.1.</li>
  <li>Run the shell command <samp>emacs</samp> to enter a editing session.</li>
  <li>Type <samp>control-H</samp> followed by <samp>t</samp>
    ("<samp>C-h t</samp>", in Emacs-ese). This should drop you
    into the Emacs tutorial.</li>
  <li>Take the tutorial.</li>
</ol>

<!-- DELETE-ME DELETE-ME DELETE-ME -->
<p>
For the following lab exercises,
use intelligent ways of answering the questions. For example, if
asked to move to the first occurrence of the word "scrumptious", do not
merely use cursor keys to move the cursor by hand; instead, use the
builtin search capabilities to find "scrumptious" quickly.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.1: Moving around in Emacs (10 points)</h3>

<oL>
<li>Download a copy of the web page you’re looking at into a
file named <samp>assign1.html</samp>. You can do this
with the following shell command:
<pre><samp><a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/'>wget2</a> <var>URL</var>
</samp></pre>
where <samp><var>URL</var></samp> is this web page’s URL.</li>
<li>Use the shell command <samp><a
href='https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/cp.html'>cp</a></samp>
to make three copies of this file. Call the copies
<samp>exer1.html</samp>, <samp>exer2.html</samp>, and <samp>exer3.html</samp>.</li>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer1.html</samp>.</li>
<li>Before continuing, run the Emacs command
            <code>M-x persist-drib lab1.1.drib</code> to create a dribble file
            <code>lab1.1.drib</code>. This records everything you type for this lab
            section.</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you’d like to redo this lab section, exit Emacs and launch it
                again.</li>
            <li>You must run the previous command each time you launch
                    Emacs to record your keystrokes. This function will append to
                the dribble file, so don’t worry about overwriting it.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>(2 points) Use searching to move the cursor to just
        after the first occurrence of the string "UTF-8" (all upper-case).</li>
    <li>(2 points) Now move the cursor to the start of the
        first later occurrence of the word "scavenger".</li>
    <li>(2 points) Now move the cursor to the start of the
        first later occurrence of the word "self-referential".</li>
    <li>(2 points) Now move the cursor to the start of the
        first later occurrence of the word "arro&#119;".</li>
    <li>(1 point) Now move the cursor to the end of the
        current line.</li>
    <li>(1 point) Now move the cursor to the beginning of
        the current line.</li>
<li>Did you move the cursor using the arrow keys instead of using Emacs’s
  searching capabilities? If so, please learn how to search, and repeat the
  above steps by doing searching.</li>
<li>When you are done, exit Emacs.</li>
</ol>

<p>For this lab section (and the subsequent ones) do not worry about
    getting each keystroke exactly correct, but do try your best. The
    autograder looks for the most "significant" keystrokes in some
    subsequence (e.g., <code>C-s scavenger</code>) as proof you’ve attempted
    the lab.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.2: Deleting text in Emacs (10 points)</h3>
<oL>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <code>exer2.html</code>.
  <ul>
    <li>The idea is to
delete its HTML comments; the resulting page should display the same text
as the original.</li>
            <li>Just like Lab 1.1, use the <code>persist-drib</code> command to
                create a dribble file <code>lab1.2.drib</code>.</li>
            <li>(2 points) You must also submit
                <code>exer2.html</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
<li>(1 point) Delete the 107th line, which is an HTML comment.
<samp>&lt;!-- HTML comments look like this, but the comment you delete
has different text inside. --&gt;</samp></li>
<li>(1 point) Delete the HTML comment containing the text
"<samp>DELETE-ME DELETE-ME DELETE-ME</samp>".</li>
<li>(2 points) Delete the HTML comment containing the text
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_comment#Comments".</li>
<li>(4 points) There are two more HTML comments; delete them too.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once again, try to accomplish the tasks using a small number of keystrokes.
When you are done, save the file and exit back to the command line. Also,
check that you haven’t deleted something that you want to keep, by using
the following shell command:</p>

<pre><code>  <a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/'>diff</a> -u exer1.html exer2.html &gt;exer2.diff
</code></pre>

<p>The output file <samp>exer2.diff</samp> should describe only text
that you wanted to remove. Don’t remove <samp>exer2.diff</samp>;
you’ll need it later.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.3: Inserting text in Emacs (15 points)</h3>
<oL>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer3.html</samp>.
        <ul>
            <li>Just like Lab 1.1, use the <code>persist-drib</code> command to
                create a dribble file <samp>lab1.3.drib</samp>.</li>
            <li>(2 points) You must also submit
                <samp>exer3.html</samp>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>(1 point) Change the first two instances of
        "Assignment 1" to "Assignment 27".</li>
    <li>(1 point) Change the first instance of "UTF-8" to
        "US-ASCII".</li>
    <li>(3 points) Ooops! The file is not ASCII so you need
      to fix the file so that
  it is ASCII.
  Most of its non-ASCII characters are the
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode'>Unicode</a>
  character <a href='https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2019/index.htm'>&ldquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;
  (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK U+2019)</a>;
  fix these by replacing each one with an ASCII
  <a href='https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0027/index.htm'>&ldquo;'&rdquo;
  (U+0027 APOSTROPHE)</a>.
  Use <code>M-x replace-string</code> to do this systematically.</li>
<li>(3 points) Find the first remaining character in the file that is not ASCII.
  You can find the next
  non-ASCII character by searching for the regular
  expression "<code>[^[:ascii:]]</code>".</li>
<li>What non-ASCII character is it? You can use <a
  href='https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Position-Info.html'><code>C-u C-x =</code>
  (<code>what-cursor-position</code>)</a> to find out.
  (No need to submit; this is just for your own curiosity.)</li>
<li>(5 points) Remove every
  line that contains a non-ASCII character other than the U+2019
  characters you already replaced.</li>

<li>When you finish, save the text file and exit Emacs. As before,
use the <code>diff</code> command to check your work.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.4: Other editing tasks in Emacs (20 points)</h3>

<p>
In addition to inserting and deleting text, there are other common tasks
that you should know, like copy and paste, search and replace, and undo.
</p>

<oL>
<li>Execute the shell command
"<code>cat exer2.html exer2.diff &gt;exer4.html</code>"
to create a file <samp>exer4.html</samp> that contains a copy of <code>exer2.html</code> followed by a copy of <code>exer2.diff</code>.</li>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <code>exer4.html</code>.
        <ul>
          <li>
The idea is to edit the file so that it looks identical
to <code>exer1.html</code> on a browser, but the file itself is a
little bit different internally.</li>

            <li>Just like Lab 1.1, use the <code>persist-drib</code> command to
                create a dribble file <code>lab1.4.drib</code>.</li>
            <li>(2 points) You must also submit <code>exer4.html</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
<li>(4 points) Go to the end of the file. Copy the new lines in the last chunk
of diff output, and paste them into the correct location earlier in the file.</li>
<li>(4 points) Repeat the process,
until the earlier part of the file is identical
to what was in the original.</li>
<li>(2 points) Delete the last part of the file,
which contains the diff output.</li>
<li>(1 point) … except we didn’t really want to do that,
so undo the deletion.</li>
<li>(2 points) Turn the diff output into a comment, by surrounding it with
  "<samp>&lt;!--</samp>" and "<samp>--&gt;</samp>".
  If the diff output itself contains end-comment markers "<samp>--&gt;</samp>",
  escape them by replacing each such "<samp>--&gt;</samp>" with
  "<samp>--&amp;gt;</samp>".</li>

<li>(5 points) Now let’s try some search and replaces.
Search the text document for the pattern "<samp>&lt;ol&gt;</samp>".
Use the search and
replace function to replace them all with the final-caps
equivalent "<samp>&lt;oL&gt;</samp>".</li>

<li>Check your work by running the shell command "<code>diff -u
exer1.html exer4.html &gt;exer4.diff</code>". The only differences
should be changes from "<samp>&lt;ol&gt;</samp>" to "<samp>&lt;oL&gt;</samp>",
and a long HTML comment at the end.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Lab 1.5: Exploring the operating system outside Emacs (13 points)</h3>

<p>There are several short questions to answer on
        Gradescope. Use the commands that you learned in class to find
answers to these questions. Don’t use a search engine like Google to
find previous editions of this assignment and/or its answers, and
don’t ask your neighbor, don’t use GitHub, etc.
When you find a new command, run it so you can see exactly how it
works.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Lab 1.6: Doing commands in Emacs (7 points)</h3>
<p>
Do these tasks all within Emacs. Don’t use a shell subcommand
if you can avoid it. (No need for a dribble file this section.)</p>
<oL>
    <li>In the <samp>assign1</samp> directory, there’s a C source file
        <samp>hello.c</samp> that contains the following text. Open it in
        Emacs.<br>
<pre><samp>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int
main (void)
{
  for (;;)
    {
      int c = getchar ();
      if (c &lt; 0)
        {
          if (ferror (stdin))
            perror ("stdin");
          else
            fprintf (stderr, "EOF on input\n");
          return 1;
        }
      if (putchar (c) &lt; 0 || (c == '\n' &amp;&amp; fclose (stdout) != 0))
        {
          perror ("stdout");
          return 1;
        }
      if (c == '\n')
        return 0;
    }
}
</samp></pre>
</li>

<li>Compile this file, using the Emacs <code>M-x compile</code> command.
</li>
<li>(2 points)
Run the compiled program from Emacs using the <samp>M-!</samp> command,
and put the program’s standard output into a file
  named <samp>hello-a1</samp> and its standard error into a file
  <samp>hello-a2</samp>.</li>

<li>(2 points) Same as before, except run the program with standard
  input being closed,
  and put the program’s standard output and error into
  <samp>hello-b1</samp> and <samp>hello-b2</samp>, respectively.
  Here, &ldquo;closed&rdquo; does not mean the standard input is an empty file;
  it means that standard input is not open at all, to any file.
  You can arrange for this via
  the <a href='https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_19_07_05'><code>&lt;&amp;-</code>
  shell syntax</a>.</li>

<li>(2 points) Same as before, except run the program with standard
  input being the file <samp>/etc/passwd</samp>,
  and put the program’s standard output and error into
  <samp>hello-c1</samp> and <samp>hello-c2</samp>.</li>

<li>(1 point) Same as before, except run the program with standard
  input being the file <samp>/etc/passwd</samp>
  and standard output being the file <samp>/dev/full</samp>,
  and put the program’s standard error into <samp>hello-d2</samp>.</li>

<h2>Homework: Scripting in the shell (25 points)</h2>

<h3>Shell scripting</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Steve Parker, <a
  href='https://www.shellscript.sh/'>Shell Scripting Tutorial</a> (2023)</li>
 <li>The Open Group,
   <a href='https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html'>Shell Command Language</a> (2024). This is the standard
   for POSIX shells, and you are not expected to read it all, though it
 can be handy to refer to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read enough about the shell to understand how to do
  I/O redirection and pipes.</p>

<p>For each shell command <samp>tr</samp>,
  <samp>sort</samp>, <samp>comm</samp>,
  read the command’s <samp>man</samp> page and
  use that to deduce what the command should do given its operands
  shown below.</p>

<p>Examine the SEASnet file <samp>/usr/share/dict/linux.words</samp>, which
  contains a list of English words, one per line.
  Each word consists of one or more ASCII characters.</p>

<p>Use <samp>sort</samp> with <samp>&lt;</samp> and <samp>&gt;</samp>
  to sort this file
  and put the sorted output into a file <samp>sorted.words</samp>.
</p>

<p>Then, take a text file (e.g., <samp>assign1.html</samp>),
and run the following shell commands with that
text file being standard input. Also, look generally at what each command outputs (in
particular, how its output differs from that of the previous command),
and why.</p>

<pre><code>
tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - sorted.words
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - sorted.words
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take the last command
as the crude implementation of an
  English spelling checker.
  This implementation mishandles the input file
  <samp>/usr/share/dict/linux.words</samp>!
  Verify this by running a shell command like this and inspecting
  the output:</p>

<pre><code>tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' &lt;/usr/share/dict/linux.words |
    sort -u | comm -23 - sorted.words
</code></pre>
<p>
  Write a shell script named <samp>myspell</samp>
  that fixes this problem.
  Your script should read from standard input and write
  misspelled words to standard output, for a suitable
  definition of "word" that is broader than just
  a maximal sequence of ASCII alphabetic characters,
  but is no broader than need be.
  The shell command:</p>

<pre><code>./myspell &lt;/usr/share/dict/linux.words
</code></pre>

<p>
  should output nothing, because
  the dictionary by definition contains only correctly-spelled words.
</p>

<h2>Common Problems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I started on the previous version of this assignment, what should I do?
            <ul>
                <li>That's okay. Just make sure to name your dribble files accordingly.
                If you used one dribble file for multiple lab sections, feel free to duplicate the files
                (the autograder can handle these cases).
                If you used multiple dribble files for one lab section, concatenate these into one file.
                For example, <samp>cat lab1.drib lab2.drib > lab1.1.drib</samp>.
                </li>
                <li>However, do make sure to move your files to the directory (stated in the Setup section) and to run <samp>./helper init</samp>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            I already downloaded <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20250409191013/https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring25/cs35L/assign/assign1.html'>the previous version of this assignment</a>; should I download this one?
            <ul>
                <li>Either one will do.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If using a typed out function (e.g. <samp>M-x replace-string</samp>), make sure to type it out in its entirety instead of using tab autocomplete.</li>
        <li>However, try to avoid using typed out functions if there is some equivalent keyboard shortcut.</li>
        <li>When searching, type out the whole search query written out in the assignment (except for that long Wikipedia URL and DELETE-ME...feel free to just search a few characters).</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
<p>For Lab 1.5, remember to complete the written assignment in
        Gradescope.</p>
<p>Submit the following files to Gradescope within a ZIP file named
    <samp>assign.zip</samp> by the posted deadline.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The HTML files <samp>exer2.html</samp>,
        <samp>exer3.html</samp>, and <samp>exer4.html</samp>.
    </li>
    <li>The dribble files <samp>lab1.1.drib</samp>,
        <samp>lab1.2.drib</samp>, <samp>lab1.3.drib</samp>, and
        <samp>lab1.4.drib</samp>.
    </li>
    <li>The <samp>hello-??</samp> files of Lab 1.6.</li>
    <li><samp>myspell</samp>. This should not have a file name extension;
        for example, it should not be <samp>myspell.sh</samp>.</li>
    <li>(Optional) <samp>notes.txt</samp>, a text file containing any other notes or comments that you'd like us to see. If
        you used a search engine or genAI, this sould include an appendix containing your search engine and/or genAI
        prompts, results, and corresponding summary/assessment.
</ul>
<p>You may also use the command <samp>./helper zip</samp> to generate
    this ZIP file. It will run some basic checks (includes all requisite
    files, the dribble files are non-empty, <samp>myspell</samp> is at least
    partially functioning) before zipping your submission.</p>
<p>Feel free to run this command before completing the whole assignment;
    a partial ZIP file will be created. You may run this through the
    Gradescope autograder to see what score you’d get up to this point.</p>
<p>To transfer the ZIP file from SEASnet onto your local computer, feel
    free to use Secure Copy (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol'>SCP</a>). For
    example:</p>
<pre><code>
scp eggert@lnxsrv15.seas.ucla.edu:~/assign1/assign.zip ~/Downloads
scp eggert@lnxsrv15.seas.ucla.edu:~/assign1/assign.zip %USERPROFILE%/Downloads # for Microsoft Windows
</code></pre>
<p>will transfer the file to your Downloads folder.</p>
<p>You have unlimited submissions; we’ll choose your best scoring one.
    Make sure that you choose the best scoring one as your active
        submission. As per the syllabus, remember that all code is
    subject to manual inspection.
